## EatifyPos:
If you're an eater, welcome to EatifyPos - your go-to online ordering platform for both dine-in and takeout. With EatifyPos, you can easily browse menus, place orders, and securely pay online for all your favorite meals.

If you're a business owner, EatifyPos is designed to make your operations smoother by streamlining your ordering, payment, and kitchen processes. Our app can seamlessly send order information to the kitchen thermal printers in real-time to prepare your food. With real-time messaging, you'll be alerted if there are any issues and faults, and our email confirmation system will notify both you and your customers every time an order is successfully placed. You can even customize the logo, title, and food items on the app's administrative page. We're also working on a management app that will transform EatifyPos into a Platform as a Service, complete with a system for you to purchase, use, and deploy the app online.

## Features
You can peruse through menus and order food for delivery or takeout through our platform. Payment can be made securely using Stripe. The merchant will receive a digital receipt via email and a physical receipt from a thermal printer. The option to track your order status in real-time will be available from March onwards. To simplify reordering, you can save your preferred orders. To begin, please access the demo at https://eatify-22231.web.app/. The Beta version of EatifyPos is scheduled for release in March and will not only include all the features mentioned above but also the capability to process verbal orders, manage the cash drawer and POS terminal, and provide revenue, tip, and tax summaries on the data summary page. Our goal is to continue development and optimization to bring EatifyPos to commercial viability.
